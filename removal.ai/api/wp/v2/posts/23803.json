We can date back the earliest application of AI in marketing to 1998 when Amazon used collaborative filtering in its operations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This collaborative filtering, a machine learning technique, enabled them to recommend products to customers related to their purchase based on other customers&#8217; purchase histories and patterns. Today, we still see such usage not just on online selling platforms but on social media. If you&#8217;re a user of Facebook, you might most likely find yourself suggesting &#8220;people you may know&#8221; based on your Facebook friends&#8217; friends (mutual friends). This type of AI technology has undeniably helped us connect to our circle more easily and, with satisfaction, get us into using Facebook continually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the early to mid-2010s, AI in marketing started to revolutionize by opening Artificial Intelligence&#8217;s use cases. We can see Yahoo in 2013 starting to use Artificial intelligence that uses Natural language processing for a faster generation of content that adjusts depending on the audience&#8217;s preferences. 2014 saw a drastic industry interest in programmatic advertising, which makes advertising targets more specific and fits leads and customers at just the right time. In 2016, Google presented one of its\u00a0 AI tools, Rankbrain, which analyzes user queries and gives relevant search results according to its interpreted user&#8217;s intent behind the analyzed search text. And in 2016 AI listening and response, such as virtual assistants and chatbots, entered the function arsenal of AI in Marketing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At present, there are countless use cases for AI in marketing, and yet so many are still being developed and released. Taking account how rapid artificial intelligence develops, we can confidently say that the way we market will continuously change as time goes by.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-23848 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image7.png\" alt=\"impact of AI\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\" srcset=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image7.png 1200w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image7-300x158.png 300w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image7-1024x538.png 1024w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image7-768x403.png 768w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image7-500x263.png 500w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image7-600x315.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Image from <\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vecteezy.com\/vector-art\/9160049-isometric-illustration-concept-investment-business-analysis-presentation\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vecteezy<\/span><\/i><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><b>The Growth of AI and Its Impact in Marketing\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The adoption of AI in marketing significantly impacts both consumers and businesses.

Customer Service<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the reasons businesses do marketing is to retain their customers and earn their loyalty. And that is achieved through high-quality customer service. And high-quality service may mean that your customers are valued, and their preferences are taken care of. Enter hyper-personalization.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hyper personalization is one of the functions brought by artificial intelligence, whereby the preferences of each customer, be it a business or individual, are processed by artificial intelligence to be used for recommendations to such customers. These preferences are processed from different data inputs, such as customer demographics, purchase history, search history, customer and shop locations, corresponding environmental and socio-economic conditions, and even other customers&#8217; data that may be relevant to a specific customer&#8217;s preference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-23883 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image12.jpg\" alt=\"algolia\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\" srcset=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image12.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image12-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image12-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image12-768x403.jpg 768w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image12-500x263.jpg 500w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image12-600x315.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An example of a good AI tool for customer service is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.algolia.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morphl.io<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.algolia.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Algolia<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> now owns. It is a software-as-a-service that gives such hyper-personalization to websites they integrate into. But of course, customer service does not limit only to hyper-personalization. It is facing and providing solutions to customer complaints and quickly answering customer queries.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>2. Data Analysis<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To keep up with the ever-changing customer needs, businesses must innovate their products continuously. They must strive to catch their customers&#8217; tastes as time goes on continually. Of course, innovation needs a lot of consideration and brainstorming. Investment in a poorly planned product creation that your customers will reject, if not be displeased with, will lead to a disaster.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Artificial intelligence, with its advancement in deep learning, and natural language processing, can gather tons of data from different sources, just like hyper-personalization, and analyze them to come up with meaningful data. This data can be used as a basis for what your target market needs or wants, so you can innovate a product that fits their tastes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One fun testament to this is how Unilever created a brand new product with the help of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.producthunt.com\/products\/popular-chips\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Popular Chips<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an AI influencer marketing platform. Their AI detected 50 songs that contained the phrases&#8221;Ice cream for breakfast,&#8221; discovering a link between breakfast and ice cream, and became the basis for creating a range of cereal-flavored ice creams.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>3. Chatbots<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of AI&#8217;s greatest breakthroughs in marketing is using chatbots.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chatbots are a form of a program with the use of AI technology capable of responding to customers through chats without the intervention of humans. Their level of intelligence can range from being able to answer a predetermined set of questions to ones that use natural language processing and data analysis to &#8220;understand&#8221; a customer&#8217;s concern.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chatbots, similar to smart assistants, definitely help both businesses and human employees alike. With simpler and frequent concerns being solved with chatbots, human customer support providers can spare their time solving repetitive yet simple concerns of clients. Concerns with more complexities and need more attention are filtered out so customer support can focus more of their time on them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Businesses and sites can also make chatbots respond to their clients and customers 24\/7 since they are made of computers and need less to no rest. It thus saves up business costs for customer support, as the need to hire more customer support agents to cover up all-time support service is lessened.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-23890 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image13.jpg\" alt=\"TIDIO\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\" srcset=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image13.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image13-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image13-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image13-768x403.jpg 768w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image13-500x263.jpg 500w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image13-600x315.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tidio.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TIDIO<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a customer service platform, is one of the chatbot providers to date. It responds to chats and follow-ups to your customers when they let items in the cart stay for a certain time, offers discounts on idling customers, and even chat suggestions that fit customers&#8217; preferences.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>4. Graphic Design<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graphics and pictures are essential elements of marketing your products and services. People are much assured of the quality of the products they buy. Pictures of your products help build up such assurance. Infographics appeal more to readers than plain text, and a good color combination and font choice must catch your audience&#8217;s attention. Effective logo designs help market your brand in peoples&#8217; minds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With its advancement, artificial intelligence can help build and edit your graphic design materials. Some AI tools combine machine and deep learning to learn from their big data inputs to learn how visual contents are appropriately made. They use natural language processing to &#8220;understand&#8221; the creators&#8217; intent and taste in making graphic content. They also use computer vision to identify relevant content and ensure quality editing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-23827 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image4.jpg\" alt=\"Brandmark.io\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\" srcset=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image4.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image4-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image4-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image4-768x403.jpg 768w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image4-500x263.jpg 500w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image4-600x315.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/brandmark.io\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandmark.io<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a logo creator, is one of the fascinating AI tools our time currently has.

SEO<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With so many content creators and copywriters, it isn&#8217;t easy to rank up in search engines. Attracting site visitors is a real challenge, and search engine optimization techniques might be complicated and hard to manage and, worst, may be ineffective. An AI that assists you in search engine optimization might work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-23855 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image8.jpg\" alt=\"Surfer SEO\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\" srcset=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image8.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image8-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image8-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image8-768x403.jpg 768w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image8-500x263.jpg 500w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image8-600x315.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/surferseo.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surfer SEO<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can significantly help develop your content while considering factors such as your average words, frequency of keywords used, and character counts.

Augmented Reality for Commerce<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Augmented reality, from the word itself, augments or bridges the real world from the virtual world. Powered mainly through computer vision and integrated with IoT such as smartphones, augmented reality aids users&#8217; imagination of how something from the virtual world materializes within the physical world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In commerce and marketing, your customers may use augmented reality to view how certain products look good in customers&#8217; spaces without even physically buying them. Cosmetic products can be virtually applied to prospective clients&#8217; faces and see if it looks appealing to them before even actually trying them out. It innovates how businesses market their products, with many benefits such as elimination of proximity and safety issues, and reduction of costs, as test products can be tested virtually instead of allocating more budget for such.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-23869 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image10.jpg\" alt=\"Magnolia Market\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\" srcset=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image10.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image10-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image10-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image10-768x403.jpg 768w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image10-500x263.jpg 500w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image10-600x315.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shopify, an e-commerce platform, now offers augmented reality to its client shops; they have successfully implemented the feature in one of their clients, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/magnolia.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Magnolia Market<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Video Marketing<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Would you even believe it? Artificial intelligence creates a video on its own for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-23841 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image6.jpg\" alt=\"Synthesia\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\" srcset=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image6.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image6-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image6-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image6-768x403.jpg 768w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image6-500x263.jpg 500w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image6-600x315.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, Artificial intelligence not only can help you edit your videos, but it can also already generate on its own. AI-based video generating platforms like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.synthesia.io\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Synthesia.io<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can create an artificial person called an &#8220;avatar&#8221; and speak in a specific tone and accent what you want them to say.

But we can expect to see significant progress soon.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>8. Social Media Marketing<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from your website, working out your market through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sotaventomedios.com\/\">social media marketing<\/a> is a must to start your traction. Social media platforms are a haven for potential clients and buyers with vast preferences and needs. Thus marketing through them must be known both on the surface and inside the industries. However, there may be too many social media sites to market on, and looking through each one of them can be more detrimental than beneficial.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Artificial Intelligence may help in marketing your content through different social media sites through their automation power. Some AI tools let you input your marketing paraphernalia and will do their job, even hyper-personalizing your content based on their target audience&#8217;s preferences. Data analysis about marketing reports is even made ready with these AI tools so that you can focus more on important tasks and decision-making steps.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-23820 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image3.jpg\" alt=\"Rasa\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\" srcset=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image3.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image3-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image3-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image3-768x403.jpg 768w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image3-500x263.jpg 500w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image3-600x315.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rasa.io\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rasa.io<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an AI-powered platform that lets you do email marketing with automation, hyper-personalize your readers&#8217; contents, and make reports to track your marketing performance and effectiveness.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>9. Customer Segmentation<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When discussing customer segmentation, we often consider the four market segments, demographic, geographic, psychographic, and behavioral. But this may be obsolete as technology takes over the industry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-23876 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image11.jpg\" alt=\"Lucrative AI\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\" srcset=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image11.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image11-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image11-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image11-768x403.jpg 768w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image11-500x263.jpg 500w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image11-600x315.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customers are now segmented in what <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lucrative.ai\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lucrative.ai<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> calls the RFM model. RFM, which stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary, are factors to track how your customers behave towards your products, your shop, the similar industries they search and buy into, and their relevant interest for how your customers are segmented. These segmentation types are more practical to use as similar interests and needs are more specified, and marketing materials can be targeted to impact them easier than traditional customer segmentation.<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lucrative.ai\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Lucrative.A<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I, an AI tool that does market segmentation, can help you. It will require several data inputs to be analyzed and group your customers based on their RFM scores.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>10. Smart Assistants<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smart assistants are similar to chatbots in how they do customer service to clients. However, smart assistants guide customers in their journey to exploring your business and products more than facing complaints.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smart assistants in the cosmetics industry may recommend certain cosmetic products to your customers based on their appearance, preferences, and recent trends. They may assist in calling human assistants, finalizing their order lists, and many more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-23897 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image14.jpg\" alt=\"Siri\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\" srcset=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image14.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image14-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image14-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image14-768x403.jpg 768w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image14-500x263.jpg 500w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image14-600x315.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One example of a smart assistant used in marketing is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/siri\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Siri<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
