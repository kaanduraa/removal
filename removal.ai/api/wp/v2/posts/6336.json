Other elements and most especially the right background to use for product photography and design should be taken into account. It is not always about focusing on the product that creates a positive and lasting impact, but it\u2019s what builds the whole that makes all the difference.<\/p>\n<h2>Background Ideas for Your Product Photos<\/h2>\n<p>The background you use for product photography will determine the feel and the message you want to convey to your customers.

Black backgrounds<\/h3>\n<p>The color black as the background is typically used by luxury products such as jewelry, cosmetics, and electronics.

Bokeh<\/h3>\n<p>Bokeh is a Japanese word that literally means \u201cblur.\u201d It is basically the out-of-focus parts of the image that was captured by the fast camera lens. This aesthetic quality directs our focus of attention to a particular area of an image or product that makes it visually appealing. It is an often used technique to create a unique background for product photography.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image4.png\" alt=\"Bokeh background for product photography\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image7.png\" alt=\"Bokeh background for product photography\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The Bokeh effect is commonly achieved with the use of the lights in the background; and by just simply highlighting an aspect of a product shot.
