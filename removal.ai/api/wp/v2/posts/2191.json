This industry is completely dependent on the power of photography wherein product photos are the most effective tool for a successful marketing strategy. Among the most common photo editing techniques, background removal seems to be the most familiar. It is very popular that many photo editing services providers are focused on developing new methods and technologies to remove background from image free and fast.<\/p>\n<h3>The Need For Background Removal<\/h3>\n<p>Humans are highly visual creatures. According to research, most people can remember 80% of what they have seen compared to only 20% of what they have read. We tend to remember how an object looks like and how it works rather than memorizing the descriptions and instructions. To create a deeper impact, entrepreneurs must find a way to create a strategy that will make the consumers retain information from the product, as much as possible, so that they will be enticed to actually buy it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"628\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2196\" src=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/01.jpg\" alt=\"Importance Of Images\" srcset=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/01.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/01-300x126.jpg 300w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/01-1024x429.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/01-768x322.jpg 768w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/01-500x209.jpg 500w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/01-600x251.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" \/><br \/>\nResearch source <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/power-of-visual-communication-infographic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blog.hubspot.com<\/a><\/p>\n<h4>Remove Distractions &amp; Build Trust<\/h4>\n<p>A background eraser seems to be the most efficient solution. First, it literally rids the picture of any clutter that could diminish a product\u2019s aesthetics. Another reason, which is the foremost purpose, is to help direct the focus towards the product instead of anything else, including the background. Leading online marketplaces also require sellers to post product photos with either a white or a <a href=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/image-transparent-background\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">transparent background<\/a>. This encourages a trusting relationship between sellers and customers because it showcases the items without any enhancements to hide flaws and imperfections.<\/p>\n<h4>Optimize User Experience<\/h4>\n<p>With today\u2019s e-commerce platforms, online shoppers are allowed to buy without any barrier or distance to worry about. Transactions are done online thus making it more convenient to choose and pay for what they want. As per human habit, it is perfectly normal to check out product details before making a purchase. Physically touching, feeling and inspecting products cannot be done online so entrepreneurs have to provide the best alternative. This is where modern technology takes care of the magic through virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and 3D modeling. Before any of these visual \u201ctricks\u201d, images should be properly enhanced and kept realistic. Integrating an image background remover to these advanced technologies result in better showcasing of products.<\/p>\n<p><img width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2197\" src=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/02.jpg\" alt=\"background eraser online\" srcset=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/02.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/02-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/02-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/02-500x334.jpg 500w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/02-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Highlight The Product<\/h4>\n<p>By removing a photo\u2019s background, it opens a multitude of possibilities for the image. It becomes more flexible as it can be used for plenty of other creative applications, such as creating a 3D model of a product. Even the process of presenting multiple angles and scenarios for a more realistic shopping experience is all thanks to a meticulous image background removal.<\/p>\n<p>It is suffice to say that without a dedicated <a href=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">free background remover<\/a>, product photos for e-commerce may look bland, inartistic, and worse, unappealing.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Learn <a href=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/how-to-sell-on-amazon-fba\/\">How to Sell on Amazon FBA<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>How to Remove Background of an Image<\/h3>\n<h4>DIY Photo Editing<\/h4>\n<p>In recent years, the only way to get perfectly-edited photos is by hiring someone who knows how to edit using image processing software, like Photoshop. Such applications require knowledge and expertise which is why you must be interested and dedicated enough to spend time and effort to master using it. This means that if you are planning to do it yourself, then you need to learn how to use the different applications. This process takes a long time because you need to start on learning the basics and spend more time to master everything, including how to perform the image background removal process.<\/p>\n<p><b>Related Post: How to Remove Background of an Image in Photoshop<\/b><br \/>\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/eFbrn0f83D0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h4>Hiring a Professional to Join the Team<\/h4>\n<p>For big companies and online entrepreneurs who can afford it, having an in-house photo editor is one of the best options. It would guarantee consistent results since the professional focuses on only one job and that is to erase backgrounds from the pictures. With this method, the entrepreneur has to consider a lot of things, mainly the cash flow. It is an investment to hire someone for a job that may be seasonal. If you are to deal with lots of photos on a daily basis, then it is a cost-effective solution. Otherwise, you risk having to pay someone even if you are done uploading product photos on the website.<\/p>\n<p><b>Related Post: <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/ephotovn.com\/hiring-background-removal-service\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>When to Hire a Background Removal Service to Assist Your Creative Operations<\/b><\/a><\/p>\n<h4>Hiring a Freelancer<\/h4>\n<p>A freelancer may be a cost-efficient solution if dealing with seasonal photo background removal projects. Because payment is only on a project basis, you get to pay only for a specific amount of work done and direct the rest of your funds to other priorities. The downside of this method is that you risk not having consistency or not maintaining a cohesive creative flow, especially if you are hiring different freelancers in every project. You tend to waste time in communicating with the freelancer and explaining how you would like the work to be done. You basically need to give instructions in order for the freelancer to get the style that you need.<\/p>\n<h4>Seeking Help From Professional Photo Editing Service Providers<\/h4>\n<p>Apart from freelancers, one of the best sources of excellent photo editors are <a href=\"https:\/\/ephotovn.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">photo editing companies<\/a>. They are typically a pool of photo editors that basically mastered one or more photo editing techniques. For example, some companies specialize in background removal while some are more adept at photo restorations. These companies also operate in different time zones so job orders are being worked upon 24\/7. They are reliable, consistent, and secure but may cost more since most of them are to be paid either on a monthly subscription or a per-image basis.<\/p>\n<p><b>Related Post: <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/ephotovn.com\/outsourcing-background-removal-freelancer-vs-photo-editing-company\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>Outsource Background Removal To A Freelancer Vs To A Photo Editing Company<\/b><\/a><\/p>\n<h4>AI-Integrated Background Eraser<\/h4>\n<p>As it is very essential in e-commerce, background removal is made easier and faster with the integration of Artificial Intelligence technology.
