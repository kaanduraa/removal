The use of the color blue is the excellent and the safest choice to use as the background for every type of marketing campaign.<\/p>\n<p>For good reasons, blue is one of the most popular colors. Blue is best for encouraging high levels of thinking and evokes feelings of peace and serenity and is frequently defined as tranquil, stable, and orderly. Blue gives a strong message of transparency and trustworthiness. It is also often used as the color of school and office walls because the color blue is closely related to productivity. Blue is everywhere around us as the sky above and as bounty as the large bodies of the ocean.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/image5-1.png\" alt=\"history of blue color\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Blue is also an excellent choice to be used as a background because it is on the other side of the color wheel that makes it the furthest hues from the human skin tones. Blue has a lower luminance value, so it does not reflect as much light as other colors. It is the safest background to use because it produces a lesser color spill that is best for subjects with small details and edges, resulting in better quality images.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h3>Brief History about the Blue Color<\/h3>\n<p>Contrary to its popularity today, historians and scientists agree that the color blue doesn\u2019t exist at the beginning of art 20,000 years ago and is the last color to be named in the English language after white, black, red, green, and yellow. The blue colorant is rarely present in nature and was first discovered by the ancient Egyptians about 6,000 years ago from Lapis Lazuli, a semi-precious stone mined in Afghanistan. With the use of chemistry to combine lapis with calcium and limestone, the blue pigments emerged. And because of its uniqueness and rarity, the blue dye was expensive enough that only royals could afford and use it for their works.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/image8-1.png\" alt=\"history of blue color\" \/><br \/>\nImage Source: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Blue#History\">Wikipedia<\/a>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/artsandculture.google.com\/story\/the-secret-history-of-the-color-blue\/bgIyIXzv_RULIA\">color blue remained rare for many centuries<\/a>, but its existence was spread through words by Egyptians from one nation to another. The blue pigment earned its value to be named in various languages to dominate the world of science and art today.<\/p>\n<h3>Cultural Significance of Blue<\/h3>\n<p>Blue is the most liked color by both men and women regardless of age and gender preference. Blue is sometimes associated with the birth of a boy, thus indicating masculinity, but in other cultures, it contemplates as a feminine color. Many religions think significantly of blue as the representation of their faith that connotes spirituality and divinity.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Blue holds valuable and diverse meanings symbolizing different cultures around the world. In Middle Eastern countries, blue is the symbol of security and protection, while in Western Cultures, it implies a melancholy feeling but at the same time indicates authority, trust, and safety. Its deep history also closely tied it to royalty, and its diverseness makes it stand out when compared with the other colors. Blue is magical and appealing, which makes people across the globe drawn and think highly of this color.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h3>Marketing Considerations Regarding the Color Blue<\/h3>\n<p>Certain colors tend to evoke specific emotions in customers resulting in brand relevance and purchase motivation.
