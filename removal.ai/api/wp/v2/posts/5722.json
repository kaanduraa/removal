With optimized images, your load time increases thereby pleasing the visitors. It also enhances the whole performance and usability of your website.<\/p>\n<p>While it is already established that image optimization is essential in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/ecommerce-statistics\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ecommerce<\/a>, many people do not take it as seriously. The main reason is that it can be a bit complicated, especially for some people who are not too oriented with how it is done. Good thing that there are APIs and a variety of SaaS applications that are intended for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/image-optimization\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">image optimization<\/a> purposes. Automation is truly a game-changer for ecommerce entrepreneurs because it makes the image optimization process more efficient and cheaper.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/SaaS-vs-APIs.jpg\" alt=\"SaaS vs APIs\"\/><\/p>\n<h3>SaaS vs API<\/h3>\n<p>SaaS or Software as a Service is an innovative tool that is developed to help businesses integrate applications that can make different business processes more efficient. Many people, on the other hand, are confused about what is an API or Application Programming Interface. Although these two terms seem to be the same, SaaS is more of a distribution model where applications can be hosted and be made available over the Internet whereas API is a way to allow other applications to be built on top of an already working application.<\/p>\n<p>Say for example you have a photo editing application, a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">background remover API<\/a> may be added so that you can include background removal on your set of services. With the addition of SaaS, you can make the application work without asking the user to download and install any software. SaaS will make the upgraded <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/free-online-photo-editor\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">photo editing application<\/a> available in the cloud so that anyone can use it as long as there is an internet connection.<\/p>\n<h2>Top 5 APIs to automate image optimization<\/h2>\n<p>When it comes to improving existing applications, APIs are what developers can rely upon to make the process seamless and quick.
