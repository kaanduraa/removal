Because everything is hosted and maintained centrally by its provider, SaaS software is automatically updated. <strong>To better understand what is SaaS, here are its four types that are categorized according to its specific uses:<\/strong><\/p>\n<h4>1. Vertical SaaS solutions<\/h4>\n<p>With this type of SaaS, the software is created in order to address specific needs. One example is for websites that offer photo editing services and <a href=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">background removal<\/a>, like Removal.AI. With Removal.AI, users can use SaaS solutions to enhance photos without having to download a photo editing software. The website itself has a background remover that is powered by AI technology so the user basically has to only upload the picture and the SaaS products will do the rest of the editing.<\/p>\n<h4>2. Horizontal SaaS<\/h4>\n<p>Compared to Vertical SaaS that is focused on specific niches, Horizontal SaaS caters to a general business need. Accounting software is under this type because different industries can use it.<\/p>\n<h4>3. Packaged SaaS products<\/h4>\n<p>For businesses that are bent on achieving specific goals, packaged SaaS products are created as an all-in-one solution. It can be a bundle of different SaaS solutions that are designed to boost the marketing and at the same time improve customer satisfaction.<\/p>\n<h4>4. Collaborative SaaS applications<\/h4>\n<p>With this type of SaaS, the software is made with the purpose of connecting team members to be able to work on a single goal. It makes communication more effective especially when there is a need to collaborate with the documentations or manage a project.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/types-of-SaaS.jpg\" alt=\"What is Saas\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>38 SaaS Statistics and Trends<\/h2>\n<p>It is valuable to know about performance metrics that can make a significant difference to the success of any business.
