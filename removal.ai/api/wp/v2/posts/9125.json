This is not surprising since the color pink entails a lot of meanings. As a delicate color, pink denotes anything sweet, nice, charming, feminine, tenderness, and romance. Objects that are associated with this light color are flowers, bubble gum, and anything to do with babies and little girls. It is also considered to represent friendship, inner peace, affection, harmony, and as the color of universal love of oneself and of others.<\/p>\n<h4>Psychology Behind Pink<\/h4>\n<p>There is no doubt about it, pink is considered to be for girls than it is for boys. No matter what, unlocking the psychology behind using the color pink for marketing can be a game-changer. For example, in some websites, the designers use light shades of pink for the calls-to-action points. While it is not the focal point of the design, it is a strategy to emphasize the most important element of the page. It is used to direct the user\u2019s attention to a specific area on the page.<\/p>\n<p>Pink, being a subdued color, is also popular among minimalist designs. The reason is that because it is lighter than most colors, pink can help tone down too strong vibes from a page. It can actually make the design look warm, inviting, and appealing to the viewers.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/cover.jpg\" alt=\"pink background\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Marketing and branding considerations regarding the color pink<\/h4>\n<p>Picking the right colors to use for marketing and branding can help bridge the gap between the marketing materials used and the target audience. It is partly aesthetic but more of a science. It has been long proven that colors can help communicate any message more effectively.<\/p>\n<p>As logos, the color pink expresses youth and fun that is appealing to the young and female audience. This is why the global brand, Barbie, has it for its logo. Aside from being associated with dainty dolls, pink can also be related to intimate apparel for college-aged women, like the Victoria\u2019s Secret PINK line.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image3-1.png\" alt=\"pink background\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For websites, the use of a pink motif, like a pink background, can be tricky. It can look overwhelming if used too much. The secret is to use it sparingly, preferably in hierarchy, so there is a contrast that makes it effective.<\/p>\n<p>Just like with any other color, the use of pink in marketing and branding will also depend on the message that you want to convey. Pink is strong and versatile but you need to be strategic in using it for your brand for it to be effective.<\/p>\n<h3>14 Sites Where to Download Free Pink Background Images<\/h3>\n<p>Want to see how you can incorporate a lovely pink background into your campaigns?

It was when American First Lady Mamie Eisenhower said that it was her favorite color that people started to associate pink to girlhood. Although this color is predominantly associated with femininity, its connotation of sweetness, romance, and innocence prove to be useful in a handful of applications.<\/p>\n<h4><b>In portrait photography<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>Pink is a toned down color of red. Both colors represent heat and passion. When working with portraits, a pink background can help stir up emotions. It can communicate playfulness when a darker shade of pink is used. In contrast, a lighter shade of pink can communicate tenderness. Knowing these will enable the photographer to translate the emotions that the subject wants to portray through the pictures.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image9.png\" alt=\"pink background\" \/><br \/>\nImage Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/mocah.org\/1032497-face-model-portrait-long-hair-brunette-red-photography-actress-dress-black-hair-fashion-hair-emma-wa.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Mocah.org<\/a><\/p>\n<h4><b>In fashion photography<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>An unexpected splash of pink can make a lot of difference in a boring fashion spread.
