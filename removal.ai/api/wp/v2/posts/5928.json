Take Good Quality Photographs<\/h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5967\" src=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image5.png\" alt=\"Product image\" width=\"1189\" height=\"669\" srcset=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image5.png 1189w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image5-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image5-1024x576.png 1024w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image5-768x432.png 768w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image5-500x281.png 500w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image5-600x338.png 600w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image5-107x60.png 107w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image5-160x90.png 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1189px) 100vw, 1189px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Even without paying for a professional photographer, you can take your product photos by simply knowing the basics of how to do proper product photography. Learn how your camera works, and experiment on different lighting and angles. You should also get essential equipment like tripods to make better images that you can work with later on.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Remove Background from Image<\/h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5939\" src=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image1.png\" alt=\"background remover\" width=\"1152\" height=\"555\" srcset=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image1.png 1152w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image1-300x145.png 300w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image1-1024x493.png 1024w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image1-768x370.png 768w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image1-500x241.png 500w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image1-600x289.png 600w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image1-125x60.png 125w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image1-187x90.png 187w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>One of the basics among online shopping portals is to have product photos with a <a href=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/plain-white-background-images\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">transparent or white background<\/a>. This makes the photos look neat and at the same time, lessens its file size when uploading. You can prepare your photos this way using a free background remover.

Adjust Brightness and Contrast<\/h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5946\" src=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image2.png\" alt=\"Product photo editing\" width=\"1353\" height=\"647\" srcset=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image2.png 1353w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image2-300x143.png 300w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image2-1024x490.png 1024w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image2-768x367.png 768w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image2-500x239.png 500w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image2-600x287.png 600w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image2-125x60.png 125w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image2-188x90.png 188w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1353px) 100vw, 1353px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The right amount of brightness and contrast helps with highlighting the details of a product.

Use Correct Dimensions<\/h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5953\" src=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image3.png\" alt=\"Product photo editing\" width=\"1352\" height=\"643\" srcset=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image3.png 1352w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image3-300x143.png 300w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image3-1024x487.png 1024w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image3-768x365.png 768w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image3-500x238.png 500w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image3-600x285.png 600w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image3-126x60.png 126w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image3-189x90.png 189w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1352px) 100vw, 1352px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Distorted images can misrepresent the actual products. It is a must that you use the correct dimensions on your online storefront in order to keep the appeal of the photos. A proper aspect ratio can also help with the download time of the browser since there is no need to resize the photos before displaying them.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Add Realistic Effects<\/h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5960\" src=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image4.png\" alt=\"Product photo editing\" width=\"1352\" height=\"739\" srcset=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image4.png 1352w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image4-300x164.png 300w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image4-1024x560.png 1024w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image4-768x420.png 768w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image4-500x273.png 500w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image4-600x328.png 600w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image4-110x60.png 110w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/image4-165x90.png 165w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1352px) 100vw, 1352px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When enhancing photos during product photo editing, it is natural to add effects that will make the photos stand out. Take note, however, that superfluous effects can also damage the genuine appeal of the products. You can instead use subtle effects like reflections and shadows to make the photos look naturally attractive.<\/p>\n<h3>Additional Tips: 5 Effective Product Photography Tips<\/h3>\n<p>After properly editing your photos, all that is left to do is to make them work on your advantage. Here are five tips to make product photos work for your online shop:<\/p>\n<h4>1. Showcase product photos at the best light<\/h4>\n<p>An inexpensive lighting kit can do wonders in creating a professional lighting effect on your photos. You may also want to experiment with natural lighting and other light sources to see which one will work best for your photos.<\/p>\n<h4>2. Stage product bundles interestingly<\/h4>\n<p>One factor that attracts buyers the most is the proper staging of products. Line them up in neat rows; group the items according to categories, etc. It can be dramatic or simple but the ultimate goal is to stir a positive reaction from the viewer.<\/p>\n<h4>3. Use graphics to tell product stories<\/h4>\n<p>The power of photo editing is that it can let you tell a story by just adding simple graphics. For example, you can show the customers that the product is waterproof by simply editing one of the photos where it repels a splash of liquid. The addition of creative elements will not only enhance the picture but also give more information about the product.<\/p>\n<h4>4. Shoot photos following the correct technical specs<\/h4>\n<p>It would be great to shoot product photos that have high resolutions, reflects the correct colors, and does not look distorted in any way. Some online shopping portals also require certain specifications like transparent backgrounds, file sizes, and even how much of the frame should be filled out.<\/p>\n<h4>5. Do a market research<\/h4>\n<p>There are many ways to get feedback from your photos while doing market research. You can use surveys, polls, or even ask your own friends to see which photos work best for the business.<\/p>\n<h2>Your Turn\u2026<\/h2>\n<p>Growing an online business can be difficult if you have the remotest idea about proper product photo editing.
