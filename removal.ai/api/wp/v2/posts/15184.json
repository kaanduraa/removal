Geometric Shapes<\/h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_15193\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-15193\" style=\"width: 1600px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-15193\" src=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-geometric-shapes.png\" alt=\"product photography trends - geometric shapes\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-geometric-shapes.png 1600w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-geometric-shapes-300x200.png 300w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-geometric-shapes-1024x683.png 1024w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-geometric-shapes-768x512.png 768w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-geometric-shapes-1536x1024.png 1536w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-geometric-shapes-500x333.png 500w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-geometric-shapes-600x400.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-15193\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/spectrum-brand.com\/blogs\/news\/8-styling-prop-tips-for-product-and-food-photography-2021\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spectrum Brand blog<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>First up, geometric photography. This style focuses on capturing unusual shapes, lines, and other forms in order to create a unique perspective within a shot. Although geometric photographs can be inspired by buildings, they are not only associated with houses or architecture. You might come up with geometric photography ideas by observing the shapes and distinctive flows of concrete on structures. These could create a specific shape from a certain angle. Or on the other hand, you might be working with objects that lend themselves to geometric compositions (see the example below from Spectrum).<\/p>\n<p><em>When working with geometric shapes in your own photography, consider the following:<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Squares and rectangles<\/strong> imply order and conformity. Keep an eye out for these forms and use them in your compositions to heighten your viewers\u2019 mood.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Circles<\/strong>, on the other hand, depicts unity, completion, and perfection. This is why circular forms can assist with attracting the eye inward and retaining the viewer&#8217;s attention on the subject when employed in an image.<\/li>\n<li>Finally, using <strong>triangles<\/strong> is an effective technique to draw focus to a certain point. They can also inspire a peaceful or active impression in the spectator depending on how it is positioned.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>2. On the Move<\/h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_15228\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-15228\" style=\"width: 1368px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-15228\" src=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-on-the-move.png\" alt=\"product-photography-trends---on-the-move\" width=\"1368\" height=\"927\" srcset=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-on-the-move.png 1368w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-on-the-move-300x203.png 300w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-on-the-move-1024x694.png 1024w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-on-the-move-768x520.png 768w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-on-the-move-500x339.png 500w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-on-the-move-600x407.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1368px) 100vw, 1368px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-15228\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: <a href=\"photoworkout.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">photoworkout.com<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Next up, we have one of the best product photography trends that just can\u2019t keep still. Farewell to boring scenes, gravity-defying objects, and movement-focused photographs have been on the rise. This dream-like product photography style is inspired by <a href=\"https:\/\/envato.com\/blog\/photo-manipulation-and-digital-art\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">surrealist<\/a> artists \u2013 think Salvador Dali\u2019s The Persistence of Memory \u2013 where nothing is quite as it seems or should be in the \u201creal world\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>There are several methods for creating photos of objects that appear to levitate or move through the air that doesn&#8217;t require a huge amount of technical knowledge. For instance, props can be used to enable products to float. Alternatively, you can use <a href=\"http:\/\/removal.ai\">background remover<\/a> to overlay a shot of your goods over a photo with an empty background<\/p>\n<p>Smaller products will be easier to manipulate and adapt to this style. Any item, beauty product, wall art, device, or even clothes can be easily positioned or edited to appear to float in mid-air.

Outdoors &amp; Nature<\/h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_15207\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-15207\" style=\"width: 1200px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-15207\" src=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-outdoor.png\" alt=\"product photography trends - outdoor\" width=\"1200\" height=\"895\" srcset=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-outdoor.png 1200w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-outdoor-300x224.png 300w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-outdoor-1024x764.png 1024w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-outdoor-768x573.png 768w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-outdoor-500x373.png 500w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-outdoor-600x448.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-15207\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fieldmag.com\/articles\/instagram-trends-outdoor-cliche-photography\" rel=\"nofollow\">Field Magazine<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>As a result of the global pandemic and lockdowns around the world, it\u2019s no wonder that photographers \u2013 and the wider public \u2013 are looking to return to nature. Photos depicting the great outdoors allow the observer to reconnect with their surroundings, concentrating on the world&#8217;s beauty rather than the often fleeting and humdrum moments of modern life.<\/p>\n<p>Using nature in photography is essential for products or services with an organic and natural emphasis, such as eco-friendly beauty brands, ethical fashion, and sustainable travel operations.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, nature can also be utilized as a backdrop for any type of photography, including portraits, panoramas, fashion, and macro photography. There&#8217;s nothing like a magnificent landscape image to set the scene for a particular campaign, or the addition of natural elements like plants and flowers to provide texture.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Monochromatic Colors<\/h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_15214\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-15214\" style=\"width: 1029px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-15214\" src=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-pulseagency.png\" alt=\"product photography trends - pulseagency\" width=\"1029\" height=\"411\" srcset=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-pulseagency.png 1029w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-pulseagency-300x120.png 300w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-pulseagency-1024x409.png 1024w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-pulseagency-768x307.png 768w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-pulseagency-500x200.png 500w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-pulseagency-600x240.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1029px) 100vw, 1029px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-15214\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/pulseconnect.agency\/?p=6728\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pulse Agency<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Monochromatic color schemes are derived from a single base hue with depth and differentiation created through all the central color\u2019s shades, tones, and tints. When you use a monochromatic color palette in your photos, the entire image is made up of a single color, which can have a big impact. Although this approach is most commonly employed for creative and aesthetic product types, many brands have embraced it since it&#8217;s a great way to denote luxury. Consumers gravitate towards monochromatic too, as it\u2019s appealing to the eye. It&#8217;s definitely one of the best product photography trends to look out for.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_15221\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-15221\" style=\"width: 1368px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-15221\" src=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-monochromatic-colors-1.png\" alt=\"product-photography-trends---monochromatic-colors-1\" width=\"1368\" height=\"927\" srcset=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-monochromatic-colors-1.png 1368w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-monochromatic-colors-1-300x203.png 300w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-monochromatic-colors-1-1024x694.png 1024w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-monochromatic-colors-1-768x520.png 768w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-monochromatic-colors-1-500x339.png 500w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-monochromatic-colors-1-600x407.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1368px) 100vw, 1368px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-15221\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: <a href=\"http:\/\/bocadolobo.com\/en\/inspiration-and-ideas\/category\/interior-design\/?utm_source=jsantos&amp;utm_medium=Pins&amp;utm_campaign=Pinterest\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bocalobo<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>You should start by choosing your monochromatic color based on the emotion that you want to evoke. For instance, if your product or target audience is bright and cheerful, choose yellow hues that are associated with the sun, openness, and energy. If you want to invite more intense, bold and fierce sensations, red is the color to go for. Just be mindful, as contrasts are so powerful that they may end up distracting the focus away from the product and centering it rather on the color palette itself.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Homespun Still Life<\/h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_15200\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-15200\" style=\"width: 1504px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-15200\" src=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-homespun-still-life.png\" alt=\"product photography trends - homespun still life\" width=\"1504\" height=\"1004\" srcset=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-homespun-still-life.png 1504w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-homespun-still-life-300x200.png 300w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-homespun-still-life-1024x684.png 1024w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-homespun-still-life-768x513.png 768w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-homespun-still-life-500x334.png 500w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/product-photography-trends-homespun-still-life-600x401.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1504px) 100vw, 1504px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-15200\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/elements.envato.com\/user\/twenty20photos\">twenty20photos <\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>With many people spending more time at home over the last two years, still-life photography has been making a major rebound across many eCommerce websites. With the pandemic and lockdowns lasting over 18 months now, it\u2019s natural that people are discovering inspiration in props curated from objects found around the home. While this trend may have emerged out of necessity, it\u2019s a great trick if you want to add context to your compositions: shooting within an environment that is familiar and comfortable for your potential customers.<\/p>\n<p>While there\u2019s no requirement about what angle the image should be taken from, the majority of these photos are shot from above, with the viewer looking down into the scene. And, now that the holidays are around the corner, you could consider doing themed photoshoots, such as for Thanksgiving or Christmas to capture the emotions of those special occasions.<\/p>\n<h3>Be Always on the Lookout for New Product Photography Trends!<\/h3>\n<p>In difficult times, people are more likely to gravitate to content to which they can relate. This can include familiar visual styles from a bygone era or seemingly ordinary scenes of everyday life. Thus, it&#8217;s important to always be aware of new and exciting product <a href=\"https:\/\/envato.com\/blog\/photography-trends\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">photography trends<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This doesn\u2019t mean we should refrain from fantasy. Providing viewers with a sense of awe is more important than ever, whether it\u2019s out of this world nature shot or seeing something ordinary presented in a brand new way. Images can transport us to a specific period of history, or to an unknown future.
